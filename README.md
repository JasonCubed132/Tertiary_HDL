# Tertiary HDL

This is my attempt at creating a HDL for 3-state logic. The 3-state logic structure being implemented is the one described by this paper [3-state logic ALU](https://louis-dr.github.io/ternalu3.html).

This HDL is being based off of Verilog. The following links are my current reading:
- [IEEE1364 Notes - Icarus Verilog](https://steveicarus.github.io/iverilog/developer/guide/misc/ieee1364-notes.html)
- [Netlist Format - Icarus Verilog](https://steveicarus.github.io/iverilog/developer/guide/ivl/netlist.html)
